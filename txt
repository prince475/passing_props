1. what do props help us accomplish?

Make a component more reusable

2. How do you pass a prop into a component

just the same way we pass attributes to an html element
<MyName title="prince">

3. Can I pass a custom prop (e.g. `blahblah={true}`) to a native DOM element?
(e.g. <div blahblah={true}>)
No
Because the JSX we use to describe native DOMelemnts will be turned into
REAL DOM elements by React. And Real DOM elements only have the properties
/attributes specified in the HTML specification. (which doesn't include properties like blahblah)

4. How do I receive props in a component

function Navbar(props) {
  return (
    <header>
      {props.value}

    </header>
  )
}
# props essentially are just objects with key, value pairs
